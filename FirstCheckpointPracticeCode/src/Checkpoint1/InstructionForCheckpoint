Write a CoordinatePair class.  One CoordinatePair object represents one point on a plane, with an int x coordinate and an int y coordinate.  In addition to the two private data variables, include the following public methods:


A constructor which takes two arguments, the x and y values 
Another constructor which takes no arguments 
Getters and setters for each variable (x and y)
A toString() that shows the x and y values in this format: 
CoordinatePair(2, -5)

A double getEuclideanDistance(CoordinatePair otherPair) method that calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between the instance CoordinatePair and otherPair.  Use the Pythagorean theorem; the Euclidean distance is the square root of the sum of the squares of the difference between the x coordinates and the difference between the y coordinates.  For example, the Euclidean distance between coordinates at (-1, 4) and (1, 3) is sqrt(2^2 + -1^2) = sqrt(5) =~ 2.236068.  Do not worry about the precision; just return the result of the calculation.   Math.sqrt() returns the square root of a positive number; Math.pow(base, exponent) returns the result of raising base to exponent (for example, Math.pow(2,3) returns 8)
