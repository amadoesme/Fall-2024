public class DescriptionGeometricShapes {
	
//	For this exercise you will need to make 4 class files. (Main)Shape.java, Circle.java, Square.java, and Rectangle.java
//
//	(A)  Add these features to the Circle.java class from the lecture examples:
//
//	Make the 'color' attribute private
//	Make a constructor with two attributes for assigning a value to radius and color when the Circle is instantiated.
//	add any missing setters or getters for the radius and color attributes.
//	Add method that returns the area  of the shape
//	 
//
//	(B) Add a class named Square.java
//
//	Give it private attributes double side and String color
//	Make a constructor with two attributes for assigning a value to side and color when the Square is instantiated.
//	Add getter and setter methods for all of the attributes.
//	Add a method that returns the area of the shape.
//	 
//
//	(C) Make the Rectangle.java class.
//
//	Also,
//
//	Add a color attribute and make it private.
//	Make a constructor with three attributes for assigning a value to width, height, and color when the Rectangle is instantiated.
//	Add getter and setter methods for all of the attributes.
//	Add a method that returns the area of the shape.
//	 
//
//	(D)  Have the main method do the following:
//
//	Instantiate two instances of the Circle class with different radius's and colors.
//	Instantiate two instances of the Square class with different sides's and colors.
//	Instantiate two instances of the Rectangle class with different sides's and colors.
//	Have the program display all of the available values for each of these 6 objects, including their areas.
