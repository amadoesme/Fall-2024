package Cookies;

public class DescriptionFortuneCookie {

	//Write a FortuneCookie.java class.  This class must have:

	//An instance, not static, variable called message, which is a String and is declared in the class but outside any method. 
	//A constructor which takes a String as its only argument and sets message to the String. 
	//An instance, not static, method, called getMessage(), which returns the message. 
	//FortuneCookie should not have a main() method.

	//Then write a driver class CookieMaker.java with a main() method.  main() should:

	//Create an array of five FortuneCookies
	//Instantiate the FortuneCookies by calling the constructor and sending five different school-appropriate messages (for example,  "You will have a great success today", "A chance meeting brings opportunity ", etc.)
	//Iterate through the array, calling getMessage() on each FortuneCookie and printing out the String returned.
